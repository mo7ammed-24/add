This is project is to add two integer number and return with summation
read the below description

For param1 = 1 and param2 = 2, the output should be
add(param1, param2) = 3.

[input] integer param1

Guaranteed constraints:
-1000 ≤ param1 ≤ 1000.

[input] integer param2

Guaranteed constraints:
-1000 ≤ param2 ≤ 1000.

[output] integer

The sum of the two inputs.
